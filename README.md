## Goals of Project 
- The goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. The primary motivation that drives the project is to use the deep learning  technology for the well-being of the people. 
- With the help of this project, we want to reduce the gap between diagnosing and treatment.
- Successful completion of the project with higher precision on the dataset could better support the dermatological clinic work. 
- The improved accuracy and efficiency of the model can aid to detect skin cancer in the early stages and can help to reduce unnecessary biopsies.
